;; @\section{Introduction}

;; @ZGnuplot is a library that aims to bring some polish to CL generated plots
;; using gnuplot.  Gnuplot is an interesting program in that it is simple to get
;; up and running and can also produce quite beautiful plots, but most users
;; never wade through the dense docs to find out how those plots can be
;; produced.  ZGnuplot will attempt to, at the very least, produce prettier
;; plots by default than gnuplot does out of the box.  It also attempts to
;; remove many of the inconsistencies that are in the gnuplot interface and to
;; remedy some of the limitations if possible, making for a simpler plotting
;; utility which is also extremely well suited for control from a Common Lisp
;; system.

;; If we are honest with ourselves, we should note that Gnuplot is not a very
;; straight forward program to use.  It has all of the cruft and archaic feel
;; of, say LaTeX, and seemingly no consistency at any level.  Gnuplot has the
;; feel of a program that has accreted over many years to become a capable yet
;; extremely inconsistent program.  So, in many ways, it is a fools errand to
;; attempt to smooth out the Gnuplot interface via a wrapper.  Indeed, I feel
;; that there is much to gain by using a solution such as Tamas Papp's plot
;; library.  That said, Gnuplot has a very large install base and many terminals
;; (output modules) which make it useful none-the-less.  The goal here is to
;; lessen pain until something unequivocally better comes along.

;; @\section{Structure of the Interface}

;; ZGnuplot plotting involves interaction with plotting functions.  Each
;; function takes a setup object and a list of {\em plottable objects} which it
;; uses to produce a plot.  A plot is a self contained object that can be sent
;; to Gnuplot in order to produce a plot.

;; The config object determines what kind of plot to make.

;; The function <<plot-array>> creates a set of plots that are arranged in a
;; grid.  This makes it simple to, for instance, give multiple viewpoints of the
;; same 3D plot.  Each of those subplots are plotted as if plot was used.  You
;; specify the plot by giving the argument list that will pass to plot.

;; The function <<plot-with-inset>> plots a graph with one inset (which once
;; again should be a well formed arg list for plot).

;; The user also specifies the function that will process the arglist.  This way
;; they plots are fully composable.

;; The fence plots are still troublesome.  They are a way to plot a series of
;; two dimensional plots it three dimensions.  Perhaps all of these dimension
;; changing setups are not well defined in this framework.  Should this be a
;; plot type?  I suppose it should be an option on the config object, but if it
;; is that, how do we have other plots that are not part of the fence show up in
;; the plot.  I am just going to leave this unanswered and unimplemented right
;; now.

;; ;; The plot attempts to determine properties of the plot.  These could be set

;; ;; In the case of mixed dimensionalities, we do something but that something
;; ;; might be nonsensical.  If we have 3D and 2D data, we can often times get away
;; ;; with a 2D plot and make a series of plots for the 3D, but a 3D plot makes no
;; ;; sense for the 2D data.  4D data and above is almost certainly too much to
;; ;; include on a 2D plot.  4D and above has a hard enough time appearing in 3D.

;; ;; The <<smart-plot>> interface attempts to perform even more intelligent
;; ;; handling of a data set.  When it detects higher dimensions, it uses the multiplot interface to plot an array of plots 

;; ;; Use the 3D box object to plot 2D on the 2D axes planes in a 3D plot?  Use the
;; ;; up-dimension to add basically a fence at an arbitrary spot?

;; \section{Dispatch on plot type}

;; @Part of what ZGnuplot gives to users is the ability to modularize and
;; organize code into code segments that make sense and correspond to the
;; service they seek to provide.

;; maybe something like this?

;; (defclass* plot-options ()
;;   ((x-range '(-10 10))
;;    (y-range '(-10 10))))

;; (deflass* frame-options ()
;;   ((x-axis)
;;    (y-axis)))

;; (defclass* plot-3d (plot-options)
;;   ((z-range '(-1 1))
;;    (cb-range '(-1 1))))

;; (defclass* plot-fences (plot-3d)
;;   ())

;; @\section{Nesting and Delaying Plots}

;; The <<with-suppressed-plotting>> macro informs the contained plot commands to
;; refrain from actually plotting the plottables and instead return a cons cell
;; containing a frame configuration object and a list of plottable objects.  If
;; plot is applied to this cons cell outside of a <<with-suppressed-plotting>>
;; macro environment, the desired plot will be produced.  This allows you to
;; defer the plotting of a graph, which allows you to nest plotting commands
;; without unnecessary intermediate plotting steps.

(defvar *suppressed-plotting* nil)

(defmacro with-suppressed-plotting (&body commands)
  "Process the specified plotting commands \(each of which should produce a
plot) but do not send the commands to Gnuplot, just return a list that PLOT can
be applied to create the plot."
  `(let ((*suppress-plotting* t))
     (list ,@commands)))

;; @The dispatching system finds the most specific match in all of the declared
;; dispatch functions and uses the one that matches your setup on the most
;; individual options (ties broken based on the order of the parameters in the
;; class, this might change because I'm not sure this is the best idea).

;; If you try to declare a dipatch that specializes on something that another
;; dispatch doesn't, all of the dispatch functions that don't specialize on that
;; parameter effectively match on anything parameter value that the new function
;; matches on.

;; Thus, if you say that something happens for all 3d plots, then you say
;; something that happens for all 3d plots that are also logarithmic plots, then
;; a linear, 3d plot will run the just 3d code, a 3d log plot will run the 3d
;; log code.

;; We develop our own dispatch system instead of using CLOS is because the
;; dispatch is based on combinations of parameters, not heirarchical as is the
;; case that CLOS excels at.  The sheer number of classes that would be needed
;; to fully specify every possibility is very large.  We also don't need the
;; fancy call chain stuff from CLOS, so we don't miss out on much.

;; @\subsection{Polar Plots}

;; Polar plots are a special type of 2D plot and of parameteric plot.  As with
;; gnuplot,this requires a separate interface.  However unlike gnuplot, the
;; interface is keeping with the <<plot>> and <<splot>> split.  This makes for a
;; more uniform interface.
